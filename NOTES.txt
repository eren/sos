Returning from exception
=====

If the exception handler entry code uses the stack to store registers
that must be preserved while it handles the exception, it can return
using a load multiple instruction with the ^ qualifier. For example, an
exception handler can return in one instruction using:

    LDMFD sp!,{R0-R12,pc}^

To do this, the exception handler must save the following onto the
stack:
    - all the work registers in use when the handler is invoked
    - the link register, modified to produce the same effect as the data
      processing instructions.

The ^ qualifier specifies that the CPSR is restored from the SPSR. It
must be used only from a privileged mode.
