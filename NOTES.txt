ARM Versions and Architectures
===============================
013-04-25 11:21:09 geist   there are ARM<N> cores, and archiecture
versions ARMv<N>
2013-04-25 11:21:17 geist   so, ARM7 == ARMv4
2013-04-25 11:21:22 geist   ARM9 == ARMv5
2013-04-25 11:21:26 geist   ARM11 == ARMv7

Registers
=========
In Application Programmer interface, r0-r13 are general purpose.

r14 - Link register (used in branching, bl and blx instructions)
r15 - Program counter

Saved Program Status Register:
In privileged modes, another register, the Saved Program Status Register
(SPSR), is accessible. This contains the condition code flags, status
bits, and current mode bits saved as a result of the exception that
caused entry to the current mode.

Returning from exception
========================
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0471c/Bgbcjggh.html

If the exception handler entry code uses the stack to store registers
that must be preserved while it handles the exception, it can return
using a load multiple instruction with the ^ qualifier. For example, an
exception handler can return in one instruction using:

    LDMFD sp!,{R0-R12,pc}^

To do this, the exception handler must save the following onto the
stack:
    - all the work registers in use when the handler is invoked
    - the link register, modified to produce the same effect as the data
      processing instructions.

The ^ qualifier specifies that the CPSR is restored from the SPSR. It
must be used only from a privileged mode.

Additional info for ^ from LDM/STM instruction page:
If op is LDM and reglist contains the pc (r15), in addition to the
normal multiple register transfer, the SPSR is copied into the CPSR.
This is for returning from exception handlers. Use this only from
exception modes.

Gcc built-in defines
====================
For beagleboard, this command outputs built-in definitions

echo | arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-a8 -mthumb-interwork -E -dM -

RealView-PB Emulation
=====================
RealView-PB is a generic ARM development board. If UART and Timer is needed, it
is easy to implement. LK has some code for it for stealing :)

geist | look in platform/realview-pb and target/realview-pb
geist | i run it with 'qemu-system-arm -machine realview-pb-a8 -kernel
build-realview-pb-test/lk.elf -nographic

When working with QEMU, the VM state can be inspected with monitor. It would be
useful to see what's going on with registers, pc, current instruction, the
layout of memory when an exception occurs, etc.
